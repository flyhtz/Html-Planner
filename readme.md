## Reflection
This project provided a valuable opportunity to practice web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout the development process, I learned the following key lessons:

Event Handling and DOM Manipulation: I gained a better understanding of how to handle user interactions using JavaScript and how to manipulate the DOM to dynamically update the webpage.

Local Storage: Implementing local storage for retaining task data between sessions introduced me to browser storage mechanisms and how to work with them.

User Interface Design: I experimented with CSS styling to make the buttons and layout visually appealing, enhancing the user experience.

Debugging and Troubleshooting: While facing challenges with the dragging functionality, I learned the importance of debugging and careful analysis of code to identify issues and find solutions.

Version Control: Using Git and GitHub for version control allowed me to track changes and collaborate effectively on the project.

Overall, this project was a rewarding experience that improved my front-end development skills and taught me about the iterative nature of coding. It reinforced the value of patience, persistence, and seeking help when needed.

Feel free to explore and further enhance the project to apply additional features or design improvements.

Might update it to be better and add more features but will only do so if I actually start using this lol
